# Nifty 50 Stock Price Analysis using Markov Chains

This project demonstrates how to use a Markov Chain to analyze and predict stock price movements for stocks in NSE's Nifty 50 index.

## Overview

A Markov Chain is a stochastic model describing a sequence of possible events where the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event. In this project, we use historical stock price data to build a Markov Chain model that predicts future stock price movements.
